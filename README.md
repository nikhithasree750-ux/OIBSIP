# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using SVM

## 📌 About This Project
In this project, I built a Machine Learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.  

This project helped me understand how supervised learning works and how to evaluate a classification model.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Loaded the Iris dataset
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained an SVM classification model
- Predicted flower species
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
